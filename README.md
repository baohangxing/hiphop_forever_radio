## Installation

-   install [ffprobe](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases), you must have ffprobe installed, which is part of ffmpeg, on your operating system in order for this app to work, since the javascript code relies on that binary to exist.

-   ```
    npm i
    npm link
    ```

    These commands will make a node-radio-start command available to be run from anywhere in your terminal.

-   Find a folder with your favorite music(.mp3) and run the command:
    ```
    > node-radio-start
    ```
